- Write a script to parse dates so if date of show passes, pull the next one to hero.

- Each band selection should be an about for that specific band.

 - Top of shows list should always be next upcoming show.
   Hide past shows, but keep them in the log(dont delete them).

   Make it greater than or equal to current date so shows on the same day will still show up on the site
